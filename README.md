# Volatility-Surface-Interpolation
This is an implementation and critique of aspects of the paper of Model-free Implied Volatility: From Surface to Index by M. Fukasawa, I. Ishida, N. Maghrebi et al. My contributions were mostly the implementation and alternative implementations themselves, as well as the critiques.
