# Volatility-Surface-Interpolation
This is an implementation and critique of aspects of the paper of Model-free Implied Volatility: From Surface to Index by M. Fukasawa, I. Ishida, N. Maghrebi et al. My contributions were mostly the implementation and alternative implementations themselves, as well as the critiques.
Code up to (but not including) cell 13 is not my contribution, but is included to allow for reperformance and testing of the model based on a heston model. Otherwise, from cell 13 onwards I have only included the code that I directly contributed, which mainly relates to the implementation of the algorithm proposed in the original paper, along with simple modifications for comparison.
